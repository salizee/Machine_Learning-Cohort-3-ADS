    "## 2. Real World Example: Amazonâ€™s AI Hiring Tool Discriminated Against Women\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2018, it was revealed that Amazon had developed an AI recruitment tool to screen rÃ©sumÃ©s and identify top candidates. However, the system **learned to favor male applicants** for technical roles, because it was trained on 10 years of past hiring dataâ€”dominated by male candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Ethics Questions & Potential Harms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bias in Data**: The system was trained on biased historical data, which excluded or down-ranked applications from women.\n",
    "- **Lack of Transparency**: Candidates were unaware of how their rÃ©sumÃ©s were being evaluated or filtered out.\n",
    "- **Discrimination**: Women applying for technical roles were at a systemic disadvantage, which could harm diversity and inclusion efforts.\n",
    "- **Reputational Damage**: Such cases can damage public trust in AI systems and the companyâ€™s brand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solutions or Mitigation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Audit Algorithms** regularly for bias using fairness metrics.\n",
    "- **Diverse Training Data** that is representative and inclusive.\n",
    "- **Human-in-the-loop** approaches where automated decisions are reviewed by trained people.\n",
    "- **Transparency in AI decisions**, providing clear explanations and appeals processes for rejected candidates.\n"
